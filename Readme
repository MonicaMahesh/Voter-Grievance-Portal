The Voter Grievance Portal is a user-friendly web application designed to help citizens register and track election-related complaints. The platform provides a seamless experience for voters to submit issues such as voter registration errors, polling booth concerns, or election service grievances. It also enables users to check status updates, upload supporting documents, and receive timely notifications from election authorities.
The system is inspired by the Election Commission of India grievance services and aims to simplify the communication channel between voters and officials.
